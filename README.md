 ## Crime Record Management System

## Project Description and Motivation:
I will be building a Crime Record Management System using PHP. I was motivated to do this project to get a better understanding on what material I will be working on for the company, ADSi. ADSi uses PHP, which is fairly new to me. I thought if I do this project in their language, it will give me a great head start on what to expect on the job.

## Pior Art:
I made two other Crime Record Management System Projects, one in Java and one in Spring Boot. The Java project was a pretty straight forward project that rely on list of information that the user could put in. Once I got to Spring Boot, I added on to the basic Java project, including up to five suspects and their personal description. This project was also connected to a database unlike the Java project. This project, however, will be in a different language as well as adding more details. This project will be more of a replica of ADSi's system that they work with on a daily basics.

## Core User WorkFlow:
- Users of the website are spilt into two groups:
  - Admin
  - Police Officers
- The user(s), depending on their role, will be brought to a different dashboard where they have full access to the features that their roles can perform in the application.
- If the user is signed up as a police officer, Their role is create the records in the application.
- Creating the record(Police Officers Only):
 - The requirements for every criminal record is shown below:
   - The record will need the criminal's name.
   - The record will need the criminal's date of arrest.
   - The record will need the criminal's county in which they were arrested at.
   - The record will need the criminal's birth year.
   - The record will need the criminal's charges.
   - The record will need the criminal's height.
   - The record will need the criminal's weight.
   - The record will need the criminal's hair color.
   - The record will need the criminal's eye color.
   - The record will need the criminal's ethnicity, or race.
   - The record will need the criminal's charges.
   - The record will need the criminal's mugshot. 
 
- If the user is signed up as a admin, their role is far more advanced than police officers. 
- As an admin, the user will have full control over the management of the website. 
- The abilities that the admin will have are listed below:
  - The admin will be able to access all records that police officers create.

   - The county's information will be listed down below:
     - The county will need the name of the county.
     - The county will need the name of the state. 
     - The county will need the population of the county.
   - Management to all records(Admin Only):
     - The records will be displayed on a table.
     - The records will have an edit option to make changes to the record.
     - The records will have a delete option to remove the record for both the application and the database.

## Crime Record Management System

# Project Description and Motivation:

I will be building a Crime Record Management System using PHP. I was motivated to do this project to get a better understanding on what material I will be working on for the company, ADSi. ADSi uses PHP, which is faily new to me. I thought if I do this project in their language, it will give me a great headstart on what to expect on the job. 

# Pior Art: 

I made two other Crime Record Management System Projects, one in Java and one in Spring Boot. The Java project was a pretty straight forward project that rely on list of information that the user could put in. Once I got to Spring Boot, I added on to the basic Java project, including up to five suspects and their personal description. This porject was also connected to a database unlike the Java project. This project, however, will be in a different language as well as adding more details. This project will be more of a replica of ADSi's system that they work with on a daily basics.

# Core User WorkFlow:

- Users of the website are spilt into two groups:
  - Admin
  - Police Officers 
- The user will be presented a different welcome screen depending on their role on the site as well as what options they can do. 
- If the user is signed up as a police officer, a Police ID is required to enter into the system. The police officers will be given more additional features, like creating a record, updating and deleting that record. The police officers can also view other reports and make changes to them if they have additional information.
- If the user is signed up as an admin, a user id is required to enter into the system. As an admin, the user will have full control over the management of the website. The admin will be able to assign officers to their counties as well as updating their status or removing them. Admin can also remove citizens from the system. The admin can also add and remove counties that they make. 
- Every user has their own profile page where they can update their information.
